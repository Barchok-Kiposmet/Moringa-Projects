## Project Author
#### This project was done by Patrick Barchok, a student at Moringa school Learning DevOps and SRE.
## Setup instructions
#### Being a simple website, all you need is internet access and follow the link, enter your DOB and Gender and submit. There are no other scripts needed to run this page. Here is the link to the page: https://barchok-kiposmet.github.io/Moringa/Index.html
#### It is also important to note that the formula does not work for the leap years. (I know, I know!, I am figuring out a work-around to be updated on a later version.)
## Technologies used: -
#### I used Javascript, HTML and CSS. Javascript is behind the logic and HTML was used for the user interface and to also accept input. CSS is primarily used to add colour and style to the page. 
#### To access the code above, the file is Project.js, for the HTML input, the file is Index.HTML and for CSS the file is Project.css
