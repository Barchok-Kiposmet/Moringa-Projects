                <h3>Background</h3>

                    <p>I am a graduate from Maseno University. I studied Bachelor of Arts with IT.
                        <br> I am CX executive with over 5 years experience in customer support. 
                        <br>    I have also worked as an Editor with a news publishing company.</p>
                    <p>I decided to take a course in programmin becuause of my love for math.
                        <br> In highschool, I got an A and this inspired me. Although I did not 
                        <br>make the cut for Math and Statistics, I enrolled into a self taught 
                        <br> data analytics class before joining Moringa for DevOps. </p>
